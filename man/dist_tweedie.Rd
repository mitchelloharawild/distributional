\title{The Tweedie distribution}
\usage{
dist_tweedie(mu = 0, phi = 1, power = 1.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{mean parameter (positive for p >= 2)}

\item{phi}{dispersion parameter (positive)}

\item{power}{power parameter, typically in (1, 2) for compound Poisson-Gamma}

The Tweedie distribution is a family of exponential dispersion models that
includes several important distributions as special cases. When the power
parameter \eqn{p = 0}, the Tweedie is a Normal distribution. When \eqn{p = 1},
it is a Poisson distribution. When \eqn{p = 2}, it is a Gamma distribution.
When \eqn{p = 3}, it is an Inverse Gaussian distribution. For \eqn{1 < p < 2},
the Tweedie is a compound Poisson-Gamma distribution, which is particularly
useful for modeling data with exact zeros and continuous positive values
(e.g., insurance claims, rainfall data).

\details{
We recommend reading this documentation on
\url{https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/distributional/}, where the math
will render nicely.

In the following, let \eqn{Y} be a Tweedie random variable
with parameters
\code{mu} = \eqn{\mu},
\code{phi} = \eqn{\phi}, and
\code{power} = \eqn{p}.

\strong{Support}:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{p = 0}: \eqn{y \in (-\infty, \infty)} (Normal)
\item \eqn{p = 1}: \eqn{y \in \{0, 1, 2, ...\}} (Poisson)
\item \eqn{1 < p < 2}: \eqn{y \in \{0\} \cup (0, \infty)} (Compound Poisson-Gamma)
\item \eqn{p = 2}: \eqn{y \in (0, \infty)} (Gamma)
\item \eqn{p = 3}: \eqn{y \in (0, \infty)} (Inverse Gaussian)
}

\strong{Mean}: \eqn{\mu}

\strong{Variance}: \eqn{\phi \mu^p}

\strong{Probability density function}:

The Tweedie density does not have a closed form for \eqn{1 < p < 2}, but
can be expressed as an infinite series or evaluated numerically.
