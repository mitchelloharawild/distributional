\title{The generalised g-and-h Distribution}
\usage{
dist_gh(A, B, g, h, c = 0.8)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{Vector of A (location) parameters.}

\item{B}{Vector of B (scale) parameters. Must be positive.}

\item{g}{Vector of g parameters.}

\item{h}{Vector of h parameters. Must be non-negative.}

\item{c}{Vector of c parameters (used for generalised g-and-h). Often fixed at 0.8 which is the default.}

The generalised g-and-h distribution is a flexible distribution used to model univariate data, similar to the g-k distribution.
It is known for its ability to handle skewness and heavy-tailed behavior.

\details{
We recommend reading this documentation on
\url{https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/distributional/}, where the math
will render nicely.

In the following, let \eqn{X} be a g-and-h random variable with parameters
\code{A}, \code{B}, \code{g}, \code{h}, and \code{c}.

\strong{Support}: \eqn{(-\infty, \infty)}

\strong{Mean}: Not available in closed form.

\strong{Variance}: Not available in closed form.

\strong{Probability density function (p.d.f)}:

The g-and-h distribution does not have a closed-form expression for its density. Instead,
it is defined through its quantile function:

\deqn{
    Q(u) = A + B \left( 1 + c \frac{1 - \exp(-gz(u))}{1 + \exp(-gz(u))} \right) \exp(h z(u)^2/2) z(u)
  }{
    Q(u) = A + B * (1 + c * ((1 - exp(-g * z(u))) / (1 + exp(-g * z(u))))) * exp(h * z(u)^2/2) * z(u)
  }

where \eqn{z(u) = \Phi^{-1}(u)}

\strong{Cumulative distribution function (c.d.f)}:

The cumulative distribution function is typically evaluated numerically due to the lack
of a closed-form expression.
